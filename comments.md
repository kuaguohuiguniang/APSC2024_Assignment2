Nice the idea of separating template declarations from definitions.
SOme methods should have been declared const. I know that constness is sometimes a pain in the neck, but it is a good practice to declare const methods as const. It is a good way to document the code and to avoid bugs.

BY the way, comments are very scarse. Thake the habit to comment using Doxigen style at least the main functions and classes. It is a good way to document the code and to help the reader to understand the code.

The resize method is incorrect.
